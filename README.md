## Description

An example of how to create dashboard on Tableau. I have referred to the below problem statement I came across on Udemy.

![project problem](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72039550/115949657-24b8d300-a4f4-11eb-84cb-77910dde34b4.jpg)

I have made use of Tableau Desktop Trial verison, where I have added cards, filters and also a calculated field for the year **2019**
The dataset is in the form of csv with about 10k rows and have chosen extract option rather than live for this dashboard.

You can directly refer to my Tableau Public profile to view as well.

# Sales_Analytics_Tableau

## Description

An example of how to create dashboard on Tableau. I have referred to the below problem statement I came across on Udemy.

I have made use of Tableau Desktop Trial verison, where I have added cards, filters and also a calculated field for the year **2019**
The dataset is in the form of csv with about 10k rows and have chosen extract option rather than live for this dashboard.

You can directly refer to my Tableau Public profile to view as well.

For Tableau trial version, go to https://www.tableau.com/products/trial and select the desired version for download and register your details ( self explanatory)

I have used **Tableau Desktop trial version** (14 days only) but you can also download and use **Tableau Public** and files get saveed automatically on Tableau Public dashboard.
